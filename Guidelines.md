- must use distrobox
- deployment on docker
- never use hardcoded urls
- frontend and backend have seperate package jsons
- never use migrations always use init.sql
- Use JWT tokens
- always create testing scripts for new features
- we are targeting android and ios for the frontend
- we must make sure that most things are reusable compnents that run individually for proof of concept
